## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

   - Make sure to include:
     - `app.py`
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `vercel.json`
     - `templates/index.html`
     - `README.md`

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add these variables:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = your_anthropic_api_key_here
     FLASK_SECRET_KEY = your-random-secret-key-here
     ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Make sure your API key is correctly set
2. **Check Logs**: Vercel provides detailed logs in the dashboard
3. **Function Timeout**: Increase timeout in `vercel.json` if needed
